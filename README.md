This project exam was going to reflect my creative and technical knowledge and skills based on the first semester curriculum. This includes design principles, project management, communication technology, and developing with HTML/CSS.

## Description

The assignment for the webpage was to create a website for an interactive science museum. They wanted a website that was informative and appealing, that should attract both middle school pupils and their parents. All content like images and text was given to us on the assignment. The site is build on HTML and CSS, and had some requirements:
- The site must have a design that appeals to the target audience.
- The site must have at least 4-6 pages.
- Compositional principles, typography, and color schemes must be considered.
- Your HTML should be semantic and neatly indented.
- The site should use external CSS style sheets which follow the DRY principle.
- The site should download quickly, and not be overly "heavy". Images should not be over 200kb.
- The site should take WCAG principles into consideration, especially regarding hierarchy, navigation, and color usage.
- The site should be responsive, attractive, and easy to use on a variety of devices.
- The site should show consideration for content strategy and SEO (consider your use of meta tags and alt text).
